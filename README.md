# Device Image Classification Using CNN & OpenCV

This project demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images of electronic devices, such as **laptops**, **mobiles**, and other gadgets. The classification model utilizes **OpenCV** for image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, etc.) and a CNN for feature extraction and prediction. 

The notebook provides step-by-step guidance to:
- Preprocess device images.
- Train a CNN model for classification.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
- Use the trained model to classify new device images.

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and real-time device classification system that works on both **laptops** and **mobile devices**.
